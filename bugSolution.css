To fix the specificity issue, we need to adjust the selectors to ensure the intended styles are applied. This might involve making the general selector more specific by adding additional classes or IDs or by using the !important flag (though this is generally discouraged) to explicitly enforce a style.  In this case, we'll use more specific selectors to target the element accurately.
